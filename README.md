# CNN digit recognition
## This is my group project in COMP3314, which is about applying a convolutional neural network (CNN) to the task of digit recognition using the PyTorch framework.
We are required to improve the recognition accuracy of this CNN by tuning several hyper-parameters and submitting a report that summarizes their trials. A code template is provided to facilitate the implementation.
## Datasets:
Each image contains a random integer between 0 and 9 (including 0 and 9). Therefore, the dataset defines a 10-category classification problem. The training set contains 3,000 samples for each category, and the testing set contains 500 samples for each category. Each input image has three channels, and each channel contains 32*32 pixels.
## Files:
The _template.ipynb_ is the template file, whose testing accuracy is about 91%-92%. The _best.ipynb_ has tuned hyper-parameters and reconstructed network architecture. Its testing accuracy is improved to 94%. 
The detailed tuning methods and performance are in the report.
